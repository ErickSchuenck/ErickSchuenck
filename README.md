# Erick Schuenck Fava Mokdeci
## About me:

Developer since 2021, studied at Driven Education. Born in 1997 in Minas Gerais, currently living and working at _Florian√≥polis - SC_, Brazil. Declared enemy of Typeorm automatic migrations, beautiful console terminals and the inexorable determinism of Laplace's demons. 

## Work Experience in technology:

###  - _Ownership Matters_
In 2022 I worked remotely in the end-to-end development of Ownership Matters' open publishing platform, a media outlet based in Washington, D.C. The platform boasts various functionalities, including text editing using the Quill library, notification sending via Nodemailer, SendGrid, and seamless image uploads facilitated by multer. React.js, coupled with styled components, powered the frontend, while TypeScript, Node.js, and Express formed the robust backend foundation. For the database, we relied on PostgreSQL integrated with the Prisma ORM. During development, we deployed the platform on Heroku, later transitioning to AWS EC2 and Nginx for hosting post-launch.

### - _DBS Digital_
Last year worked as Oracle Developer at DBS Digital in Juiz de Fora - Minas gerais. In my role, I utilized various ORACLE tools such as Autocomplete //Design Studio, Fast Formula, Oracle Digital Assistant, Oracle SQL, OTBI, and Oracle Integration Cloud. In this position I had the valuable opportunity to delve into the functionalities of HCM systems for notable organizations like Furukawa, Manserv, Moura Batteries, and CCR, actively contributing to their operational success.

### - _Coopercompany_
Since late 2023, I've immersed myself back into hard-coding as a Developer at Interstar where I collaborate with a talented development team. In this role, I specialize in React, NestJS with TypeORM, and perform seamless integrations with external platforms, like clicksign, and (unfortunately) directus. Working within a collaborative team environment I exercise my organizational skills. Additionally, I proficiently handle SQL databases, particularly PostgreSQL. Currently, I am deeply engaged in the Libertas project, driving innovation and excellence in software development.
